            The much-anticipated{" "}
            <strong className="text-blue-600">
              Dholera International Airport
            </strong>{" "}
            is nearing the completion of its Phase 1 — a landmark moment for
            Gujarat’s smart city vision. This milestone will vastly improve
            regional connectivity and attract global investors to the{" "}
            <strong>Dholera Special Investment Region (SIR)</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Phase 1 features a <strong>3,200-meter runway</strong>, advanced ATC
            tower, cargo and passenger terminals, and modern airport facilities.
            As of mid-2025, over 80% of civil work is complete, with operations
            expected to begin by late 2025 or early 2026.
          </p>

          <p>
            Strategically located just 20 km from the SIR, the airport will be
            pivotal for cargo logistics, manufacturing industries, and business
            travel—boosting Dholera’s global appeal.
          </p>

          <p>
            This phase will accommodate{" "}
            <span className="text-green-700 font-medium">
              2 million passengers annually
            </span>
            . Future phases aim to include dual runways and scale up to 20
            million passengers per year, transforming it into a major aviation
            hub in western India.
          </p>

          <p>
            Backed by the <strong>Airports Authority of India (AAI)</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>Gujarat Government</strong>, and <strong>NICDC</strong>, the
            ₹1,300 crore project reflects a strong public-private synergy and
            long-term infrastructure vision.
