        <p>
          <strong className="text-blue-600">Dholera</strong> is one of India’s most promising smart investment zones in 2025. With rapid infrastructure growth — including the <strong>Ahmedabad–Dholera Expressway</strong> and <strong>Dholera International Airport</strong> — land prices are on the rise and will continue to climb.
        </p>

        <p>
          In high-demand zones like the <strong>Activation Area</strong>, land prices have reached ₹9,000–₹12,000 per sq. yard, with projections estimating ₹18,000–₹25,000 by 2027 due to demand from developers, industries, and logistics parks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fringe zones currently priced at ₹3,000–₹5,000 per sq. yard offer strong early-stage ROI potential. These regions are expected to see 2.5×–3× growth in the next 4–5 years as TP schemes expand and road networks are completed.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Top investment strategies for 2025:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800">
            <li>Choose TP Schemes with finalized boundary and title clarity</li>
            <li>Prioritize land near expressway intersections or metro routes</li>
            <li>Focus on Activation Area and Phase 1 Development sectors</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Demand is increasing from both Indian and overseas investors. With the <strong className="text-green-700">Tata semiconductor plant</strong>, <strong>solar parks</strong>, and <strong>data centers</strong> under development, Dholera is positioned as a long-term high-yield zone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Government-backed development, energy-efficient zones, and next-gen infrastructure make 2025 an ideal entry point for investors before large-scale commercialization inflates land values.
