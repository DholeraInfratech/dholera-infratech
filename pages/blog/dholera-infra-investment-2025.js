          In 2025,{" "}
          <strong className="text-blue-600">Dholera Smart City</strong> is
          commanding national and international attention with its
          world-class infrastructure pipeline. Backed by the{" "}
          <strong>Gujarat Government</strong> and the{" "}
          <strong>
            National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (NICDC)
          </strong>
          , Dholera is witnessing accelerated development across key
          sectors.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ongoing <strong>Ahmedabad–Dholera Expressway</strong>, the
          under-construction <strong>Dholera International Airport</strong>,
          and dedicated <strong>logistics and power corridors</strong> are
          reshaping the region into a future-ready industrial and
          residential destination.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to latest investment estimates, over ₹1.5 lakh crore is
          being pumped into Dholera’s infrastructure. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3">
          <li>Stormwater and underground utilities for 100% coverage</li>
          <li>Plug-and-play industrial zones and logistic clusters</li>
          <li>
            Dedicated freight corridor integration and data center hubs
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div className="border-l-4 border-blue-600 bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-md text-gray-700 italic shadow">
          “Dholera is setting a benchmark for urban and industrial
          infrastructure in India. From digitized grids to resilient roads,
          the ecosystem is built for scale.”

        <p>
          With smart power systems, high-speed optical fiber networks, and
          green energy zones, Dholera has become a magnet for companies in
          semiconductors, EV manufacturing, warehousing, and real estate.
        </p>

        <p>
          For investors, 2025 offers a golden window to capitalize on
          Dholera’s fast-track development—before Phase 1 lands are fully
          saturated. Real estate, industrial plots, and long-term commercial
          leases are in high demand.
